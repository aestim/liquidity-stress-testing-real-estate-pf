## 📌 Executive Summary

**Project Profile:**

- Commercial parking tower development adjacent to new district court
- 77% initial LTV, 3.4x leverage
- Anchor Tenant Secured: 1st floor fully leased to E-Mart Everyday (Fee-based: 4% of monthly revenue), providing a guaranteed baseline cash flow and driving traffic.

**The Core Risk:** Despite securing a blue-chip anchor tenant, the project faces severe liquidity risk due to a critical 3-month window between completion (Month 16) and refinancing (Month 19). The compounding PF interest (~220M KRW/mo at 14%) drastically outpaces the initial NOI, leading to rapid equity erosion before the property can be fairly valued for refinancing.

## 🎯 Core Problem: The 3-Month Refinancing Window

Cap Ratio:    100%          40%          0%            0%
```

### The Challenge

| Phase | Timeline | Revenue | Interest | Risk |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Construction** | 0-16m | Zero | 10-18% (100% capitalized) | Construction delays |
| **Critical Window** | 16-19m | Starting | 10-18% (40% capitalized) | **Highest equity burn** |
| **Refinancing Gate** | Month 19 | - | Rate reset | Refinancing failure risk |
| **Stabilization** | 19-24m | Ramp-up | 5-9% (0% capitalized) | Market risk |
| **Post-Opening** | 24-36m | Stabilized | 5-9% (0% capitalized) | Sustained operations |

**Month 16-19 (Critical 3-Month Window):**

- Building just completed - Baseline revenue begins strictly from the E-Mart anchor lease.
- Still paying construction-phase rates (10-18% p.a.) on the massive 19B KRW debt.
- While E-Mart provides downside protection, it only covers ~20-30% of the total capacity. The remaining vacant units generate zero trailing NOI.
- **The structural flaw:** The E-Mart revenue alone is mathematically insufficient to cover the compounding debt service, leading to aggressive equity erosion before upper-floor leases stabilize**

**Month 19 (Refinancing Gate):**

- Property value = (3-month trailing NOI × 12) / 5.5% cap rate
- Bank requirement: Current Debt ≤ Property Value × LTV (70-85%)
- **Success:** Interest drops to 5-9%, debt service manageable → survival likely
- **Failure:** Cannot refinance, rates stay at 10-18% → default likely within 3-6 months

**Month 24 (Court Opening):**

- District court opens → primary demand driver activates
- Revenue stabilizes at 80-100% capacity
- No longer a critical gate (already refinanced at Month 19)

## 📊 Key Results

### Outcome Probabilities (30,000 simulations)

| Outcome | Probability | Description |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| Successful Exit | 65% | Positive equity at Month 36 |
| Default | 25% | Equity wipeout before refinancing (Month 16-19) |
| Refinancing Failure | 10% | Debt exceeds LTV limit at Month 19 |

### Risk Metrics

- **95% VaR:** 75% of initial equity
- **Expected Loss:** 32% of equity base
- **Median IRR (exits):** 8.5% annualized
- **Survival Rate Bottleneck:** Month 16-19 (steepest decline due to 3-month window)

### Why Projects Fail

| Failure Mode | Probability | Timing | Root Cause |
| :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **Default** | 25% | Month 16-19 | High rates + insufficient revenue → equity wipeout |
| **Refi Failure** | 10% | Month 19 | 3-month trailing NOI too low → can't meet LTV |
| **Success** | 65% | Month 36 | Survived both critical gates |

## 📈 Strategic Recommendations

### Pre-Construction

1. **Equity buffer:** Increase 30-40% above base case to absorb 3-month negative carry
2. **Rate hedging:** Fix construction rate ≤12% to reduce downside exposure
3. **Accelerated construction:** Reduce completion time 16→14 months to shorten high-rate period

### Critical Window (Month 16-19) - HIGHEST PRIORITY

1. **Leverage Anchor LOC:** Use the signed E-Mart Letter of Commitment (LOC) to negotiate "Forward-looking NOI" valuations with lenders, bypassing the standard requirement for 3 months of historical trailing NOI.
2. **Aggressive lease-up:** Offer 2-3 months rent-free on upper floors to accelerate occupancy, strictly aligning with E-Mart's grand opening traffic.
3. **Operating reserves:** Pre-fund 3 months of debt service shortfall using the remaining equity buffer.

### Refinancing (Month 19)

1. **Forward-Valuation Push:** Refuse traditional trailing-average appraisals. Force lenders to value the asset based on "In-Place NOI" secured by the corporate anchor.
2. **Conservative LTV target:** Aim for 70% (not 80-85%) to ensure approval even under stressed cap rate assumptions.
3. **Alternative lenders:** Line up backup refinancing sources that specifically favor corporate-backed lease agreements.

### Post-Refinancing (Month 19-36)

1. **Debt paydown:** Use excess cash flow to reduce principal aggressively
2. **Court opening coordination:** Monitor district court construction timeline
3. **Exit timing:** Optimize sale timing for maximum stabilized NOI multiple

## ⚠️ Limitations & Assumptions

### Model Assumptions

1. **Interest rates independent across phases** - No correlation between pre/post refi rates
2. **Revenue distributions static** - Does not account for market cyclicality
3. **No explicit macroeconomic scenarios** - Recession, rate shocks not modeled
4. **Single-asset analysis** - Portfolio diversification effects not considered
5. **Fixed refinancing timing** - Month 19 not optimized dynamically
6. **Deterministic court opening** - Month 24 assumed certain (not stochastic)

### Data Requirements

- Accurate construction timeline estimates
- Reliable market rent/occupancy data for 3-month ramp-up
- Lender refinancing appetite (LTV assumptions)
- District court construction schedule certainty

### Not Suitable For

- ❌ Early-stage land banking projects
- ❌ Multi-phase developments with complex waterfall structures
- ❌ International projects with FX risk
- ❌ Projects with significant regulatory uncertainty
- ❌ Residential projects with different absorption patterns

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Why only 3 months between completion and refinancing?**  
A: Banks require trailing NOI to value the property, but construction lenders demand repayment soon after completion. 3 months is the minimum window to build operating history while maintaining construction loan terms.

**Q: Why not refinance at Month 16 (immediately at completion)?**  
A: Standard banking policies require at least 3 months of trailing NOI (historical operating data) to underwrite refinancing, effectively blocking Month 16 execution for empty buildings. However, securing a corporate anchor like E-Mart is the "cheat code" to challenge this rule, allowing developers to push for early refinancing based on contracted future cash flows.

**Q: What if the 3-month NOI is weak but improving?**  
A: Most banks mechanically use a trailing 3-month average. The zero-revenue period during initial tenant fit-outs (rent-free periods) heavily drags down this average, causing valuation shortfalls. This underscores why relying solely on historical NOI is fatal for highly leveraged projects.

**Q: Can you delay refinancing beyond Month 19?**  
A: Yes, but at a massive financial cost. If the property valuation is too low to successfully refinance at Month 19, developers typically have no choice but to negotiate a maturity extension with the existing PF lenders. Lenders often agree to avoid an immediate default (EOD), but the developer must continue paying the exorbitant construction-phase interest rates (10-18% p.a.). This is a desperate survival tactic, not a strategy, as it rapidly bleeds any remaining equity or operational revenue until the building achieves a higher valuation.

**Q: What's the relationship between court opening (Month 24) and refinancing (Month 19)?**  
A: Court opening is the primary demand driver but occurs 5 months AFTER refinancing. Banks at Month 19 are betting on future demand. If court construction is delayed, refinancing becomes much harder.
