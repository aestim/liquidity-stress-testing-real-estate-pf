## 📌 Executive Summary

| Item | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Project** | Commercial parking tower (adjacent to District Court) |
| **Leverage** | **77.2% LTV** (3.39x Leverage) |
| **Anchor** | **E-Mart Everyday** (1st floor, fee-based lease) |
| **Core Risk** | **Refinancing Gap:** Critical liquidity burn between Month 16-19 |

> [!CAUTION]
> **The 3-Month Death Valley:** PF interest (~220M KRW/mo) at 14% far exceeds early-stage NOI, leading to rapid equity erosion before the Month 19 refinancing gate.

### The Challenge

| Phase | Timeline | Revenue | Interest | Risk |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Construction** | 0-16m | Zero | 10-18% (100% capitalized) | Construction delays |
| **Critical Window** | 16-19m | Starting | 10-18% (40% capitalized) | **Highest equity burn** |
| **Refinancing Gate** | Month 19 | - | Rate reset | Refinancing failure risk |
| **Stabilization** | 19-24m | Ramp-up | 5-9% (0% capitalized) | Market risk |
| **Post-Opening** | 24-36m | Stabilized | 5-9% (0% capitalized) | Sustained operations |

**Month 16-19 (Critical 3-Month Window):**

- Building just completed - Revenue is anchored by E-Mart Everyday and supplemented by initial early-moving tenants.
- Still paying construction-phase rates (10-18% p.a.) on the massive 19B KRW debt.
- **The structural flaw:** While the E-Mart anchor significantly accelerates overall lease-up, the combined initial NOI during this 3-month fit-out/rent-free period is still mathematically insufficient to cover the compounding debt service and hit the demanding LTV threshold, leading to equity erosion.

**Month 19 (Refinancing Gate):**

- Property value = (3-month trailing NOI × 12) / 5.5% cap rate
- Bank requirement: Current Debt ≤ Property Value × LTV (70-85%)
- **Success:** Interest drops to 5-9%, debt service manageable → survival likely
- **Failure:** Cannot refinance, rates stay at 10-18% → default likely within 3-6 months

**Month 24 (Court Opening):**

- District court opens → primary demand driver activates
- Revenue stabilizes at 80-100% capacity
- No longer a critical gate (already refinanced at Month 19)

## 📊 Key Results

### Project Risk Summary (30,000 simulations)

| Outcome | Probability | Timing | Root Cause & Description |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **Refinancing Failure** | **92.8%** | Month 19 | **Critical Bottleneck:** E-Mart NOI alone is insufficient to meet the 19B KRW LTV gate |
| **Successful Exit** | **7.2%** | Month 36 | **Best Case:** Requires exceptional early lease-up of upper floors to offset debt |
| **Default** | **0.0%** | Month 16-19 | **Downside Protected:** E-Mart baseline revenue effectively neutralizes immediate insolvency |

### Risk Metrics

- **Expected Shortfall:** ~5.7B KRW (Average capital injection required upon refi failure)
- **95% VaR:** 100.0% of initial equity (Full loss potential in refi failure scenarios)
- **Median IRR (exits):** 50.0% annualized (High-risk, high-reward profile)

## 📈 Strategic Recommendations

### Pre-Construction

1. **Equity buffer:** Increase 30-40% above base case to absorb 3-month negative carry
2. **Rate hedging:** Fix construction rate ≤12% to reduce downside exposure
3. **Accelerated construction:** Reduce completion time 16→14 months to shorten high-rate period

### Critical Window (Month 16-19) - HIGHEST PRIORITY

1. **Leverage Anchor LOC:** Use the signed E-Mart Letter of Commitment (LOC) to negotiate "Forward-looking NOI" valuations with lenders, bypassing the standard requirement for 3 months of historical trailing NOI.
2. **Aggressive lease-up:** Offer 2-3 months rent-free on upper floors to accelerate occupancy, strictly aligning with E-Mart's grand opening traffic.
3. **Operating reserves:** Pre-fund 3 months of debt service shortfall using the remaining equity buffer.

### Refinancing (Month 19)

1. **Forward-Valuation Push:** Refuse traditional trailing-average appraisals. Force lenders to value the asset based on "In-Place NOI" secured by the corporate anchor.
2. **Conservative LTV target:** Aim for 70% (not 80-85%) to ensure approval even under stressed cap rate assumptions.
3. **Alternative lenders:** Line up backup refinancing sources that specifically favor corporate-backed lease agreements.

### Post-Refinancing (Month 19-36)

1. **Debt paydown:** Use excess cash flow to reduce principal aggressively
2. **Court opening coordination:** Monitor district court construction timeline
3. **Exit timing:** Optimize sale timing for maximum stabilized NOI multiple

## ⚠️ Limitations & Assumptions

### Model Assumptions

1. **Interest rates independent across phases** - No correlation between pre/post refi rates
2. **Revenue distributions static** - Does not account for market cyclicality
3. **No explicit macroeconomic scenarios** - Recession, rate shocks not modeled
4. **Single-asset analysis** - Portfolio diversification effects not considered
5. **Fixed refinancing timing** - Month 19 not optimized dynamically
6. **Deterministic court opening** - Month 24 assumed certain (not stochastic)

### Data Requirements

- Accurate construction timeline estimates
- Reliable market rent/occupancy data for 3-month ramp-up
- Lender refinancing appetite (LTV assumptions)
- District court construction schedule certainty

### Not Suitable For

- ❌ Early-stage land banking projects
- ❌ Multi-phase developments with complex waterfall structures
- ❌ International projects with FX risk
- ❌ Projects with significant regulatory uncertainty
- ❌ Residential projects with different absorption patterns

## ❓ FAQ & Strategic Insights

This section details the financial assumptions behind the **3-month "Death Valley"** and the **Month 19 Refinancing Gate**.

<details>
<summary><b>Q: Why is there a 3-month gap between completion and refinancing?</b></summary>

* **Bank Underwriting:** Refinancing lenders (Facility Loans) require a **"Trailing NOI"** (Net Operating Income) to verify the asset's cash-flow stability before committing capital.
* **Operational Runway:** It takes a minimum of 3 months to complete tenant fit-outs, clear rent-free periods, and document actual rent deposits in bank statements.
* **💡 Strategic Insight:** This 3-month window is the project's most vulnerable phase, where high construction interest (10-18% p.a.) aggressively erodes equity before stabilization.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Q: Why can't we refinance at Month 16 (Day 1 of Completion)?</b></summary>

* **Vacancy Risk:** Without operating history, banks view the building as an "empty shell," significantly slashing the LTV (Loan-to-Value) ratio based on liquidation value rather than income value.
* **The "E-Mart" Cheat Code:** By securing **E-Mart Everyday** as a blue-chip anchor tenant, we can negotiate with lenders to recognize **"Forward-looking NOI"** based on signed lease agreements, potentially shortening this window.
* **💡 Strategy:** The model tests whether this "Anchor-Tenant Strategy" provides enough leverage to bypass traditional 3-month trailing requirements.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Q: What if the 3-month NOI is weak but improving?</b></summary>

* **The "Average Trap":** Lenders typically use a **simple 3-month trailing average**. 
* **Valuation Impact:** Zero-revenue months (due to rent-free periods or fit-outs) at the start of the window can "drag down" the entire valuation, causing an **LTV breach** even if Month 19's performance is strong.
* **💡 Risk Management:** This underscores why relying solely on historical NOI is fatal for highly leveraged PF projects.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Q: What happens if refinancing is delayed beyond Month 19?</b></summary>

* **Maturity Extension:** While lenders may grant an extension to avoid immediate default (EOD), the cost is catastrophic.
* **Financial Bleeding:** The project remains stuck with **10-18% p.a. construction rates**.
* **💡 Warning:** This is a survival tactic, not a strategy. At this stage, approximately **0.22B KRW** in cash is "evaporated" monthly into interest payments, rapidly zeroing out the developer's equity.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Q: How does the District Court opening (Month 24) affect the Month 19 gate?</b></summary>

* **Timing Mismatch:** The District Court is the primary demand driver for high-rent legal offices, but it opens **5 months AFTER** the critical refinancing window.
* **Lenders' Bet:** Refinancing banks at Month 19 are essentially "betting" on the court's timely completion.
* **💡 Critical Path:** If the court construction is delayed, the probability of refinancing failure spikes, as upper-floor stabilization becomes speculative rather than certain.
